      "In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the founder of our store launched an online children's clothing store in Samarkand. The idea came after several unsuccessful purchases - the wrong size, low quality, and the stores were closed.",
      "She decided to look for wholesale suppliers: first in Uzbekistan, then in Turkey and China. That's how the goal emerged - to help other mothers buy quality clothes at an affordable price.",
      "The first customers were relatives and friends. For 3 years the store worked online, but due to numerous requests from customers an offline store was opened.",
      "Since April 2023, we offer high-quality clothing for children from 0 to 14 years old, working only with trusted manufacturers from China, Turkey and the USA."
